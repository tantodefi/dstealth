# 🚀 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## 🎯 **Objective**
Deploy fixed agent with database reset + clean up stale payment links while preserving conversation history.

## 📊 **Issues Being Fixed**
- ❌ **Database Encryption Issue**: Agent can't process XMTP messages due to SQLite corruption
- ❌ **Stale Payment Links**: 14/15 payment links created without fresh fkey.id verification  
- ✅ **Conversation Preservation**: Keep all 10 real user conversations and 648 messages

---

## 🔥 **PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

### ✅ **Code Changes Ready:**
- [x] Fresh database path with timestamp (forces clean database)
- [x] Enhanced database recovery logic (backup + fresh creation)
- [x] Stream health monitoring (auto-restart on stalls)
- [x] Fresh fkey.id verification for all payment links
- [x] Payment link cleanup instructions generated

### ✅ **Local Testing Completed:**
- [x] Agent resilience improvements tested
- [x] Conversation data extracted and analyzed  
- [x] Payment link security analysis completed
- [x] Cleanup instructions prepared

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Commit & Push Changes**
```bash
cd /Users/rob/xmtp-mini-app-examples
git add .
git commit -m "Fix production database + payment link security: fresh DB path, enhanced recovery, fresh fkey.id verification"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Deploy to Render**
1. 🌐 Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. 🔍 Find your backend service: `xmtp-mini-app-examples`
3. 🚀 Click **"Manual Deploy"**  
4. 📊 Monitor deployment logs for success messages

### **Step 3: Monitor Deployment Logs**
Look for these **SUCCESS INDICATORS**:
```
✅ "Using fresh production database: /data/xmtp/production-xmtp-TIMESTAMP.db3"
✅ "XMTP client created successfully"
✅ "Agent initialized successfully"  
✅ "dStealth Agent is now listening for messages"
✅ "Starting agent health monitoring..."
```

### **Step 4: Verify Agent Recovery**
```bash
cd /Users/rob/xmtp-mini-app-examples/backend
yarn audit:conversations
```
Expected output:
```
✅ Agent is responding

## 🧹 **PAYMENT LINK CLEANUP**

### **Frontend LocalStorage Cleanup**

#### **1. dStealth Mini App (https://dstealth.vercel.app)**
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
// Clear all payment link localStorage
localStorage.removeItem('payment-links');
localStorage.removeItem('payment-history');
localStorage.removeItem('user-payments');
localStorage.removeItem('payment-cache');
localStorage.removeItem('daimo-payments');
localStorage.removeItem('stealth-payments');

// Clear any cached payment data
for (let i = 0; i < localStorage.length; i++) {
  const key = localStorage.key(i);
  if (key && (key.includes('payment') || key.includes('daimo') || key.includes('checkout'))) {
    localStorage.removeItem(key);
  }
}

// Clear session storage too
sessionStorage.clear();

console.log('✅ Payment link data cleared');
```

#### **2. Browser Cache Cleanup**
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (`Cmd+Shift+Delete` on Mac)
- Select "Cached images and files"  
- Select "Cookies and other site data"
- Choose "Time range: All time"
- Click "Clear data"

#### **3. Verification**
```javascript
// Check that payment data is gone:
console.log('Payment links:', localStorage.getItem('payment-links'));
console.log('Payment history:', localStorage.getItem('payment-history'));
// Should return null for both
```

## ✅ **POST-DEPLOYMENT TESTING**

### **1. Agent Response Test**
Send a test message to the agent:
```
Message: "Hi"
Expected: Agent responds within 5 seconds
```

### **2. Fresh Payment Link Test**  
Send a payment request:
```
Message: "Create payment link for $10"
Expected Response Format:
💰 **Your Stealth Payment Link** (Fresh Data ✅):
https://pay.daimo.com/checkout?id=...
🔐 **Verified Identity**: username.fkey.id
🥷 **Live Stealth Address**: 0x...
```

### **3. Database Health Check**
```bash
yarn db:test
Expected: ✅ Connected
```

### **4. Service Worker Cleanup Verification**
Check that the service worker is automatically cleaning up stale payment links:

```bash
# Test cleanup metrics endpoint
curl https://YOUR_FRONTEND_URL/api/cleanup-metrics

# Expected response:
{
  "message": "Service Worker Cleanup Metrics Endpoint",
  "description": "POST endpoint for receiving payment link cleanup metrics from service workers"
}
```

**Monitor Cleanup in Real-Time:**
1. 🌐 Open browser dev tools (F12)
2. 📊 Go to Console tab  
3. 🔄 Refresh the frontend page
4. 👀 Look for service worker cleanup logs:
```
SW: Cleaning up payment links from 1 client(s)
🧹 SW: Received payment link cleanup request
🗑️ SW: Removed localStorage key: payment-links
✅ SW: Payment link cleanup completed: {keysRemoved: X}
SW: Payment link cleanup completed: X keys removed
```

## 📊 **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Database Recovery:**
- ✅ Agent responds to messages within 5 seconds
- ✅ No more "sqlcipher_page_cipher" errors in logs
- ✅ Fresh database path shows in logs
- ✅ Stream health monitoring active

### **Payment Link Security:**
- ✅ All new payment links show "Fresh Data ✅"
- ✅ All new payment links show "Live Stealth Address"
- ✅ No more stale fkey.id data usage
- ✅ Frontend localStorage cleared via service worker

### **Service Worker Cleanup Monitoring:**
Monitor these metrics in frontend logs to verify automated cleanup effectiveness:
```
🧹 SERVICE WORKER CLEANUP METRICS:
==================================
Clients Contacted: X
Successful Cleanups: Y  
Total Keys Removed: Z
✅ Cleanup Effectiveness: XX% (Y/X clients)
🗑️ Payment Link Security: Z stale keys removed from user sessions
```

**Expected Cleanup Results:**
- ✅ **High Keys Removed (>5)**: Confirms many users had stale data (security fix working)
- ✅ **Cleanup Effectiveness >90%**: Most browser sessions successfully cleaned
- ✅ **Automatic Operation**: No manual user action required

### **Data Preservation:**
- ✅ Users can continue existing conversations
- ✅ Conversation history visible in XMTP apps
- ✅ Agent rebuilds user context automatically
- ✅ fkey.id setups preserved in database

---

## 🚨 **ROLLBACK PLAN**

If deployment fails:
1. **Revert code changes**: `git revert HEAD`
2. **Redeploy previous version**: Trigger Render deployment
3. **Check old logs**: Review previous working state
4. **Debug specific error**: Use production logs to identify issue
